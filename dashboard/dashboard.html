    <p> A completed to attempted pass ratio is a main way of comparing quarterback's passing accuracy and efficiency. In this chart above it shows the amount of passes each quarterback attempted and and threw. Looking at a graph like this you can compare how many passes were completed, and obviously to have an efficient passing quarterback, you want them to have a much higher completed to attempted pass ratio.

        The graph above represents the pass percentage of each quarterback This is simply used to look at the completed to attempted pass ratio but at an easier and more simple way to compare them. All you have to do is look at the position of the player's dot relative to the graph. Clearly a dot that has a dot that is further to the right and higher than the other, simply means that quarterback was a lot more sufficient, passing wise. But one thing that must alwasy be taken into thought is what kinds of passes the quarterbacks are making. For example, a quarterback that throws more deep balls, or does not have as great of receivers, is going to have a much lower percentage than the other quarterback. This i something to keep in mind, but also requires further research. </p>

    <p> The graph above is used to compare the amount of touchdowns each quarterback had throughout the season. This is obviously the ending goal of every drive, and is started at the quarterback. If the quarterback is doing bad, then there will be no touchdown period. So this is used to show what quarterback could move the ball down the field and convert for a touchdown the most.

<div id="hypo">
    <p> Hypothesis: By looking and comparing these graphs, to be an efficient and successful passing quartback based on the 2019 season, quarterbacks must to have thrown at least 250-300 passes, had a completion percentage of at least 60%, and completed 20 touchdowns. I say these stats because to even be considered a passing quarterback, he must to have thrown at least 15-20 passes a game, and been able to complete more than half of those throws, then one of the main things to see how a quarterback is, is seeing how wel l they can throw within the redzone and for touchdowns period. Because if there is no touchdowns then there is not winning.
